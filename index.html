<a href="https://github.com/nicolewhite/neo4j-flask">Flask and Neo4j</a> by <a href="https://github.com/nicolewhite">nicolewhite</a> is drawn from <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/">Flask's tutorial</a> on building a microblog application, which expands the microblog application to include social features made possible by using <a href="http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/">Neo4j</a> instead of SQLite as the backend database.</p>
Here I'd like to rebuild <a href="https://github.com/boltomli/Neo4jAssets/tree/master/AssetsViewSP">.NET+Neo4j Asset</a> in Flask+Neo4j the similar way. In addition, as part of a training session, I'll rewrite the document in Chinese.<p>

{% assign posts = site.pages | sort:"index"  %}
<ol type="1">
  {% for post in posts %}
    {% if post.main == yes %}
    <li>
      <a {% if post.url == page.url %}class="active"{% endif %} href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">
        {{ post.title }}
      </a>
    </li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ol>
